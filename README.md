# Normalize CSS

Personal CSS which I use for resetting all default styling. Grab it! ✊ If you like ❤

### Use with a CDN

To rapidly include the minified production file in your webpage

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KunalTanwar/normalize-css/normalize.min.css`

An optional version `*.inter.scss` or `*.inter.min.css` in which I set [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) as default font.
