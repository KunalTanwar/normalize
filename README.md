# Normalize CSS

Custom CSS which I use for resetting all default styling.

## Use with a CDN

To rapidly include the minified production file in your webpage

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KunalTanwar/normalize/css/normalize.min.css"
/>
```

### An optional version 
_`normalize.inter.min.css`_ in which [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) is set as default font with fallbacks.

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/KunalTanwar/normalize/css/normalize.inter.min.css"
/>
```

## Browser Support

## Note

I know there are many libraries like this and also the very famous one created by [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/necolas) which you can find on [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) but it is just a personal thing which I felt like sharing with you.
